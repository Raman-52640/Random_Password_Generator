# Random_Password_Generator

A random password generator is a software tool or online service that creates unique and secure passwords by combining a set of characters, symbols, and numbers in a random manner.

The goal is to produce a password that is:

* Unpredictable: Difficult for hackers to guess or crack using automated tools or dictionary attacks.
* Long: Typically 12-16 characters or more, making it harder to brute-force.
* Complex: Incorporates a mix of character types, such as uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
